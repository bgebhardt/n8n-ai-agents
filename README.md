==> Caveats
Please note that upstream has asked us to make explicit managing
nvm via Homebrew is unsupported by them and you should check any
problems against the standard nvm install method prior to reporting.

You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:
  mkdir ~/.nvm

Add the following to your shell profile e.g. ~/.profile or ~/.zshrc:
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/nvm/0.40.3 will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
upon upgrade/reinstall.

How to Add Developer-Approved Testers to a Google Cloud App

To allow specific users to access your Google Cloud app while it is in testing and has not completed Google verification, you need to add them as testers or grant them access through your Google Cloud project. Here‚Äôs how you can do this:

**1. Add Testers via Google Cloud IAM**

- Open the IAM page in the Google Cloud Console.
- Select your project.
- Click **Add**.
- Enter the email address of the tester you want to approve.
- Assign appropriate roles (such as Viewer, Editor, or a custom role needed for app testing).
- Click **Save**.

This gives the tester access to the project and allows them to use the app as a developer-approved tester[1][4].

**2. For OAuth Apps in Testing**

If your app uses OAuth and is still unverified, only users added as testers in the OAuth consent screen settings can use the app without seeing the "unverified app" warning or hitting the 100-user cap. To add testers:

- Go to the Google Cloud Console.
- Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**.
- In the **Test users** section, click **Add users** and enter the email addresses of the testers.
- Save your changes.

Only these users will be able to authorize with your app while it is unverified[3].

**3. For Firebase App Distribution (if applicable)**

If you are distributing a mobile app for testing using Firebase:

- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Navigate to **App Distribution** > **Testers & Groups**.
- Click **Add tester**.
- Enter the tester‚Äôs email address and click **Add tester**.

This process is specific to Firebase App Distribution and is used for mobile app testing[2].

| OAuth Consent Screen   | APIs & Services > OAuth consent     | Add emails under ‚ÄúTest users‚Äù                                                        |
| Firebase App Distribution | App Distribution > Testers & Groups | Add tester‚Äôs email, click ‚ÄúAdd tester‚Äù                                               |

**Note:**  
- Only users you explicitly add as testers will be able to access the app until it is verified and publicly available[3][4].
- If you need to test new OAuth scopes, use a separate development project and add testers there as well[5].
